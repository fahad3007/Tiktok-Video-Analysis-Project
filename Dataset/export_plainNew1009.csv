12, let's talk about russia again because some things in it really need explaining allow russian politics is based off one thing and as two problems russia has with geography because geography is not really kind to russia and basically destroy things to always remember when talking about russia the northern european plain unrestricted sea port access and nukes so let's talk about the northern european plain right here in grey is the northern european plain and what it is is an area of flatland with no mountains no rail large lakes no rail on transversal rivers what it basically means is that if you're here you can pretty much walk to russia would i really much pr problem and russia has seen that a lot it's what happened with napoleon it's what happened world war one as what happened in world war two day are used to this and they are very conscious of it and what they see what nao is poland czech republic germany slovakia slovenia lithuania latvia estonia on possibly no ukraine all on that northern european plain all join a nato and true russia's history whoever had that northern european plain dane went on to attack russia and the fear of that the fear of people basically taken that easily take a bow area and army's just march and into russia is what led them to great nukes dot became to remain determined then because there was no mountains there is nothing to stop army's coming in but their nukes were there then we have to talk about murmansk ports murmansk port is very important to russia because it is the only port in russia that doesn't freeze during the winter is the only porch with unrestricted sea access that means that in all of russia only one port can be used for trade true oh dear every other port can only be used in summer because it freezes put that into perspective this is russia look at all the coastline has my biggest country on earth only one city in that small little red area has pores that can be access trout ear now in recent history russia has basically always used a port in crimea as well because the ag grants access to the mediterranean along with constancy access however in twenty fourteen a pro russian government was ousted in a coup supported by america a pro western pro european pro nato government was put into ukraine and days seemed more iffy about letting russia use one of their biggest ports and then a month or two after russia to crimea russian politics and mentality is basically based off the geography that they have been dealt with and through geography that really helps them and it's one that they have seen in our history actually really hindered him like instead afraid of emotions are more likely to be in favor of stability even if it,0_anarchistleek_1643206611_7057518650525306118,0

26, this is a really interesting image that's come out of supposedly the kiev region of ukraine and what we're looking at is a pretty common type of booby trap where people will go ahead and remove the pin from a grenade and insert a wire to be pulled out and act as a trip mechanism to set it off what's unique about this one is the russian set it up inside a beehive outside the cave and they had it set up so when the beekeeper pulled the cover off the hive it would set off the booby trap but what us beekeepers know is bs generally coat just about any foreign object in propolis and that's exactly what they did here they put the propolis all over the firing mechanisms so when the beekeeper opened up the hive absolutely nothing happened they would not fire so great job bs,0_bearded_bee_man_1665937945_7155148935613599022,0

173, president just unveiled the new sanctions being imposed on russia in connection with our g seven partners after the invasion of ukraine the president also said he will be sending an additional seven thousand us troops to germany to support our nato allies in eastern europe now the goal of the sanctions according to president biden is to do several things including cut off russia from the global financial market cut them off from access two imported technology and hit more of the so called russian elite who share in the kremlin's ambitions the g seven includes the uk united states canada japan germany france and italy plus the e u these sanctions are more severe than the ones imposed earlier this week but no one including the president believes that these will emerge idiot lie stop putin from further invasion of ukraine the sanctions are meant to hurt putin and the russian economy over the long term if the g seven and the u s can stomach the possible kickback that may come to all of our countries as a result i'll talk more about how that works in a second but first today's sanctions cutting off russia from trade in dollars euros yen and and all currencies of the g seven that according to biden will further weaken the ruble which the white house says has already hit its weakest stately settlement price on record even before today's announcement the sanctions also cut off several additional russian banks from more than one trillion dollars in assets that are right here in the united states the president said this is more substantial than kicking russia out of the swift banking system they will choke off russia's import of technological goods that they need to evolve their military and telecommunications seizing assets and sanctioning additional russian elites who have their money here in the united states which is substantial finally the u s has also sanctioned belarus for supporting russia's invasion of ukraine by sanctioning twenty four inch visuals and entities associated with their military and financial system president biden again reiterated he has no plans to send us troops into ukraine to fight against russia but says the united states will still support the ukrainian people with humanitarian relief the president was frank when he said he is going to do what he can to insulate the american consumer from the kickback of all of this but the fact is we are,0_lisaremillard_1645736719_7068385374040493358,0

179, russia and alaska are very close to each other that fact was proven in an amazing fashion this week when two russian men fled their country's war in a small boat and landed in alaska we've discussed how close russia and alaska are before but i assume most of you to mia like my wife does so to sum up russia and alaska are separated by a relatively small bit of ocean called the bering sea at their closest point their coasts are only about fifty five miles apart from each other if you include islands they are actually just two and a half miles apart you can actually walk across from the u s island to the russian island in winter it's a whole other thing i covered one of my first videos show about the russians who landed in alaska this week they sailed from very far east eastern russia in area called chukotka across the bering sea to st lawrence island a remote alaskan island that's about fifty miles from the nearest russian coast they apparently were seeking asylum from conscription in the ukraine war it's the first time that we know of anyone using this route to seek asylum in this war and one of a very very few instances in our whole history prior to world war two many u s islands in the bering sea were on relatively friendly terms with their neighbor islands on the russian side which makes sense since the indigenous populations that live here are closely connected and never had those borders anyone since the second world war russia moved most of their islanders to mainland russia and travel across the bering sea border has been very rare it's very isolated very cold and very dangerous have you ever seen deadliest catch at just a small portion of the bering sea the russian nationals landed in the small town of gamble on st lawrence island an american indigenous community of about six hundred people it's not the first time the people of gay campbell have had a surprise russian encounter in a nice story from the cold war a soviet plane emergency landed in gamble in nineteen seventy four the soviets requested refueling and the u s army actually flew out fueled the hell the next day the plane took off from gamble and had dipped it's wings over the island in a gesture of thanks before leaving back to russia that's true the russians that landed there this week rip quarterly came from a small town here though it's not clear if they sailed from there which is about three hundred miles away or if they traveled by land to a closer point they were reportedly flown to anchorage where they are being vetted by department of homeland security american politicians took this opportunity to call for greater protection of the alaskan coast but given this route's perilous and unpredictable nature it's unlikely that we'll start seeing hordes of russians coming through this way but hey you never know ,0_map_nerd_1665262084_7152246144901467434,0

371, the doomsday newington virginia injuring watch dot org and our purpose of our site is to expose the issue of global climate engineering otherwise term is geo engineering we are virtually under assault right now it's not alarmists and it's not exaggeration this type of weather modification puts out chemicals and toxins some known some not known many people who try to debate this issue if they ask you why they should believe this is going on we have film of it happening into the argument that's it there's no debate no discussion this is not speculation when we have films that we can clearly see are spraying there's no denying that jet is spraying period we have interior films which of their interior footage which i'll show in a moment but the bottom line is that's not a condensation trail any notion that it is simply denial or complete ignorance so this is you can even see on this jet that the each side of the plane the plumes are different links which means the nozzles are not aligned perfectly you see different composition in the trail also indicative of different materials being expelled from different portions of the aircraft so again this amounts to weather warfare period the u s has historically engaged in weather warfare around the globe this is historical fact we have data going back to vietnam nineteen sixty eight project popeye nineteen seventy six un passed resolutions forbidding weather modification in wartime so again this is not speculation we haven't we live in a society that's been trained to shut down when they hear the word conspiracy theory they've been conditioned pretty well but the bottom line is this is this is the issue that can't be ignored any longer people can ignore kennedy people could ignore false flag events like vietnam and even whatever happened on nine eleven but this issue can't be ignored when interstate for example we turn on our water faucets and nothing comes out that's the end of the road this is very recent this is from two days ago al gore use of geo engineering to head off climate change disaster is insane so although we don't i have an admission is going on it's getting closer by the day and it looks like al gore is trying to now distance himself from these programs that he has not admitted to yet this is important media they'll be seeing more of this more in the in the coming coming weeks one interior shot there again we can't know from the variance of different planes the different configurations of spray apparatus this is an ongoing experiment there's likely many different configurations we see aircraft trails that have different color composition so this is an ongoing experiment of which we are all apart like it or not another interior high pressure tanks when this image was posted the sites that initially posted it a couple of them are taken down this image appeared to be tried to be taken off the net as quickly as possible but too many people downloaded it's out there now more configurations obviously there's a whole lot of planes with a whole lot of tanks doing a whole lot of something so this kind of footage should not be ignored clearly these are what would appear to be passenger planes most of them with windows so there appear to be many different types of aircrafts involved in the spring activities this is what we have again global geoengineering the ever-changing experiment and we are again part of that experiment russian scholar warns of secret us climate change weapon we have russia engage in this as well we also have china and this is one of the reasons why so hard to get any sort of mainstream coverage because the big players are all involved up to their eyeballs so that that's one of the reasons the media coverage is so sparse but it's coming whether whether weapons do they wreak havoc in countries without anybody knowing they're even under assault in the case of floods droughts all of this is a form of whether weaponry and weather warfare and there's no arguing that we are all a part of weather warfare when our climate is being impacted the way it is right now again countries around the globe this sort of impact nobody would recognize as being an assault and that's what's surprised about whether warfare for the powers that be nobody even knows they're being attacked bridges infrastructure wiped out can literally bring a country to it's knees you can bring a state to it's knees as well especially a state that doesn't seem to want to conform too much with the federal government you can drought drought them out completely and that's exactly what's happening in california right now this sort of drought in africa has been used for decades we know these programs have been going on and their impact in africa appears to be directly related to bringing countries to their knees and opening up the door for u s occupation of us boots on the ground at about one hundred and fifty six countries around the globe not singling out the u s because other countries again as i said are at this as well empty reservoirs this is where california's headed today i think we all know that we if we reach the end of this year without significant rainfall we will be in freefall into a cataclysm that's never before been recorded our forests are going up in flames as geo engineering impacts the system from top to bottom it starts to feed itself as you cut off the moisture for boreal forests which are the lungs of the planet the terrestrial ends of the planet and they begin to burn that feeds into the entire climate cycle begins to tilt even further off scale so this is a non linear equation once it starts to tilt it tilts faster and faster these sorts of clouds historically have not been well recorded now they are this sort of sky that many begin many have become accustomed to and think is somehow normal is anything but this is this is an aerosol coverage of all of you seem to have seen before and many people have begun to accept this as being natural but it takes a lot of material to block the sun to that degree and all that material settling down and all all of us were all breathing it in anybody

378, it's cold climate change must be a hoax there goes the usual cry every year at this time when the temperature gets a bit low yes the climate is changing doesn't mean to say that seasons end we still have winter the fact is that generally winters much while much milder and shorter than they have historically been but even when they when it's not when it is really cold out the that may in fact be if not caused certainly amplified by climate change so in the past when there was a big temperature difference between the cold pole and the warm warmer areas near the equator that you've got a strong jet stream spinning round the planet effectively trapping the cold air around the poles but what's happening now as the poles are warming up far more than any other area of the of the planet that temperature differentiate is getting less and therefore that jet stream that was strong is getting less strong and then for getting more wavy and what happens when it becomes wavy means that it pulls cold frigid air from the poles down into more temperate regions and you get these big freezes that way been happening recently and this has always happened but as the jet stream gets weaker and more wavy and it's pulling down lower so it's actually affecting countries which previously perhaps or areas like florida or texas for example in america at the moment that never previously were affected by it so rather than at acting as evidence against climate change is actually further evidence that climate change is happening and it's having a really strong effects on our weather making sometimes areas colder than perhaps they would otherwise have been but nonetheless the overall trend is warming and warming winters and considerably warmer winters actually,1_apocalypsenext9_1671942006_7180936212117556486,1

404, is it possible for a man to disrupt this incredible precision that god has created there are some current concerns that leaves this global warming largely political discussion and that is mankind is unequivocally the reason that the planet is heating up and they are destroying this earth and they need to stop mankind needs to speak up for the trees mankind is making more koch carbon dioxide cars and fossil fuels fill in the blank burning the forest so there's a couple of reasons on why they are can i learned about these things and one of them is the thermal highly circulation that is a conveyor belts of warm water that travels along the east coast of the us called the gulf stream carries heat up to the northern continents like europe back down and then there's like warm water on top and cold water on the bay bottom and that can affect the weather and then they're concerned about the western antarctic ice sheet which is not in water it's actually anchored on land and it's important to make a point there because the ice that is already inside the water if it melts the water temperature stays the same because it's just an ice cube on top of water and that mouth there is no problem but the ice sheet like the antarctic ice sheet that is anchored on land if that melts that then pours into the water and it does rise season sea levels now they are alarmed that because it's parts of it are slipping into the ocean one reason why that is happening is because underneath the ice sheet there is about three hundred va all chinos three hundred active volcanoes continuously going off so it keeps the ice nice and lubricated and can cause the ice to slip into the ocean if all the i slipped into the ocean it could rise the sea levels by about twenty meters and by by new york by by florida and also the res out of the coastlines around the world ,1_biblicalchristianliving_1634998385_7022264588934712581,1

422, prince charles is facing criticism once again over donations to one of his charities according to the sunday times that charles received a one point two million dollar donation from osama bin laden's half-brothers in two thousand and thirteen the donation from bakar bin laden and shafiq bin laden reportedly came after a meeting between charles and becker at clarence house in october of two thousand and thirteen according to the outlet charles accepted the donation to the prince of wales charitable fund despite objections from his key advisers however the claims are disputed by charles's office at clarence house in a statement they claim that the prince of wales charitable fund has assured them that thorough due diligence was undertaken in excess getting this donation the statement added that the decision to accept was taken by the charity's trustees alone and any attempt to characterize it otherwise is false a royal source also counters the assertion that charles brokered the deal and agreed to accept the donation against the objections of his advisors and that he refused recommendations from some staff hers to return the money in nineteen ninety four bin laden family publicly disowned him and there is no suggestion that his half-brothers had links to his activities or have any known ties to terrorism sir ian cheshire who is the chair of the prince of wales charitable foundation also countered the claims made in the report he tells people in a statement that the donations were,1_butchbouchardq17_1659395452_7127049175518301446,1

454, but now decline is there a policy that is the focus of tonight's angle now it's been twenty months with democrats in charge of congress and the white house so we thought tonight would just ask this question how are things looking well let's do a quick inventory shall we first the economy is collapsing we do begin though with our talk of the favorite is this ugly market down again today sharply after a one day reprieve and now fresh concerns about what lies ahead for your money we appear to be drifting into war with russia russian president vladimir putin told his people that the u s is bent on destroying the russian homeland on wednesday he drafted three hundred thousand reservists and threaten nuclear war this is not a bluff he said and china is threatening the united states laughs obviously that's crime rising across the country our schools are failing our people are being poisoned by fentanyl greatest threat facing our communities our families our children is the cartels the two cartels in mexico that are responsible for the wii vast amount of fentanyl that is in the united states today and our borders are undefended this is a plan disaster by the by the administration is hurting the entire country now faced with all these facts the biden regime has decided to focus on three priorities number one find a way way to indict donald trump for anything number two find a way to blame ron desantis for the harm resulting from a hurricane and number three try to get you know the midterm voters to choose more abortions over restoring prosperity and safety no wonder populism is booming everywhere no wonder most of the watch races that were closer leaning democrat just a few weeks ago are now either toss ups are leaning republican now i want you to look at wisconsin where incumbent sen ron johnson who was supposedly in a weak position a few weeks back is now up five against mandela barnes or tim mitchell's who's in essentially a dead heat with incumbent liberal tony evers and the governor's race there and then doctor oz while he's closing in on mister hoodie without a clue john fetterman he's only down by four so people are waking up not just to the wreckage that the democrats and their policies have left behind but i think now more of you are starting to ask is all this intentional or as texas state aj you just heard him say ken paxton he called the border nightmare a planned disaster now remember even before biden's inauguration they began to flash the green light to central americans essentially it was beyond any of those i mean we knew right how to restore the border restore order they're close it down because trump did it but biden did the opposite he ditched the remain in mexico pa policy and put carla in charge if there was ever a sign that the white house never intended to enforce our border that was it another clue that this was intentional biden and his crew have made it abundantly clear that they think america has a terrible past that informs our present racism is an american problem gets reflected in discrimination in housing and employment in the justice system racism is real in america and it has always been xenophobia is real in america and always has been sexism to original sin of slavery weaved white supremacy into our founding documents and principles now if america is truly systemic cli racist you know after brown vs board of education after the civil rights movement after the election of the first black president two times how can the system that is that corrupt after all of that be saved at all well the answer from the left is it can't be saved they hate our constitution they hate our judeo-christian tradition they hate capitalism and they now believe it needs to be reset courtesy of george soros now the reset which they've discussed ad nauseum on college campuses and at davos requires a complete reordering of all of society but especially american society that means things like no more employment no more jobs based on objective criteria or merit in the two hundred and thirty two year history of the u s department of treasury to hold that position she's making history first black woman the first openly gay member of the biden administration the first openly trans assistant secretary for health you get the point the biden cabinet top staff and they're presiding over one nightmare after another they offer no solutions only actions that make matters worse but their firsts so we all should just forget about the failures so an administration that was focused on truly serving the american people truly improving their standard of living and safety they would have canned yelling at treasury may orcas austin at the pentagon granholm and energy buddha judge from transportation they would have been fired months ago so it leads us to the only the sensible conclusion their goal is our decline but today inflation that you know yell and ignored well it has the markets down to it's lowest point since november twenty twenty i believe there is a path through this that can succeed in bringing down inflation while also maintaining what i think all of us would regard as a strong labor market my god how is she even employed the supply chain that mayor pete has was supposed to address it still messed up over one point five billion dollars are going into grant awards across the country announced today to build that world leading transportation system strengthen supply chains create jobs advance equity and improve economic opportunity and china's on the move in south and central america and even funding russia's war in ukraine meanwhile john kerry the climate czar is left begging china to keep focusing on climate change what can be done about china's seeming reluctance to participate in the affairs of climate controls that other nations will try to make the china interestingly enough the china has a plan more electric vehicles will be put on the road over the next year or so in china than in all the rest of the world put together okay you get the drift here america is humiliated that clip from john kerry is an example of our humiliation or poorer and we're weaker and it's just the way the left loves it because they want to create as many wards of the state as they can as many people dependent on the government as they can why do you think the left wing governors refused to open during covert when it was obvious they could because what they care more about families and young people police they didn't care about the families of the young people this was all about setting the stage for the new normal a new normal when you would have less freedom less travel a lower standard of living lowered expectations i remember when global elites are in power they'll always always find an excuse to take away your freedom under bush it was nine eleven and the patriot act of course the pandemic the lockdowns and big tech censorship then it was january six and the deo js domestic terror focus and now of course they cite climate change they'll ban gas-powered cars gas appliances and cause energy prices to skyrocket remember through all of this to them we are the real threat and they feel that they need to restrain us this is why they are so threatened by people like georgia maloney the new italian prime minister she's warning our citizens not to fall for this domination play of the left she wants italian schools to teach not to turn students against their parents or their culture in what really unnerved them m is that she actually quotes gk chesterton could even buy chests that are not automatically signify froggy but not the sad even the most fanatical do you do if o'clock spot animals growing up it was

463, the doomsday newington virginia injuring watch dot org and our purpose of our site is to expose the issue of global climate engineering otherwise term is geo engineering we are virtually under assault right now it's not alarmism it's not exaggeration this type of weather modification puts out chemicals and toxins some known some not known many people who try to debate this issue if they ask you why they should believe this is going on we have film of it happening into the argument that's it there's no debate no discussion this is not speculation when we have films that we can clearly see are spraying there's no denying that jet is spraying period we have interior films which of their interior footage which i'll show in a moment but the bottom line is that's not a condensation trail any notion that it is simply denial or complete ignorance so this is you can even see on this jet that the each side of the plane the plumes are different links which means the nozzles are not aligned perfectly you see different composition in the trail also indicative of different materials being expelled from different portions of the aircraft so again this amounts to weather warfare period the u s has historically engaged in weather warfare around the globe this is historical fact we have data going back to vietnam nineteen sixty eight project popeye nineteen seventy six un passed resolutions forbidding weather modification in wartime so again this is not speculation we haven't we live in a society that's been trained to shut down when they hear the word conspiracy theory they've been conditioned pretty well but the bottom line is this is this is the issue that can't be ignored any longer people can ignore kennedy people could ignore false flag events like vietnam and even whatever happened on nine eleven but this issue can't be ignored when interstate for example we turn on our water faucets and nothing comes out that's the end of the road this is very recent this is from two days ago al gore use of geo engineering to head off climate change disaster is insane so although we don't i have an admission is going on it's getting closer by the day and it looks like al gore is trying to now distance himself from these programs that he has not admitted to yet this is important media they'll be seeing more of this more in the in the coming coming weeks one interior shot there again we can't know from the variance of different planes the different configurations of spray apparatus this is an ongoing experiment there's likely many different configurations we see aircraft trails that have different color composition so this is an ongoing experiment of which we are all apart like it or not another interior high pressure tanks when this image was posted the sites that initially posted it a couple of them are taken down this image appeared to be tried to be taken off the net as quickly as possible but too many people downloaded it's out there now more configurations obviously there's a whole lot of planes with a whole lot of tanks doing a whole lot of something so this kind of footage should not be ignored clearly these are what would appear to be passenger planes most of them with windows so there appear to be many different types of aircrafts involved in the spring activities this is what we have again global geoengineering the ever-changing experiment and we are again part of that experiment russian scholar warns of secret us climate change weapon we have russia engage in this as well we also have china and this is one of the reasons why so hard to get any sort of mainstream coverage because the big players are all involved up to their eyeballs so that that's one of the reasons the media coverage is so sparse but it's coming whether whether weapons do they wreak havoc in countries without anybody knowing they're even under assault in the case of floods droughts all of this is a form of whether weaponry and weather warfare and there's no arguing that we are all a part of weather warfare when our climate is being impacted the way it is right now again countries around the globe this sort of impact nobody would recognize as being an assault and that's what's surprised about whether warfare for the powers that be nobody even knows they're being attacked bridges infrastructure wiped out can literally bring a country to it's knees you can bring a state to it's knees as well especially a state that doesn't seem to want to conform too much with the federal government you can drought drought them out completely and that's exactly what's happening in california right now this sort of drought in africa has been used for decades we know these programs have been going on and their impact in africa appears to be directly related to bringing countries to their knees and opening up the door for u s occupation of us boots on the ground at about one hundred and fifty six countries around the globe not singling out the u s because other countries again as i said are at this as well empty reservoirs this is where california's headed today i think we all know that we if we reach the end of this year without significant rainfall we will be in freefall into a cataclysm that's never before been recorded our forests are going up in flames as geo engineering impacts the system from top to bottom it starts to feed itself as you cut off the moisture for boreal forests which are the lungs of the planet the terrestrial ends of the planet and they begin to burn that feeds into the entire climate cycle and begins to tilt that even further off so this is a non linear equation once it starts to tilt it tilts faster and faster these sorts of clouds historically have not been well recorded now they are this sort of sky that

464, i'm about to debunk global warming thirteen thousand years ago the pyramids of giza were built three different groups of scientists actually found large amounts of water erosion mainstream scientists called them crazy and the big question was how could there be water erosion in the largest desert it's actually because egypt used to be a tropical climate and what happened was the pole shifted okay and this can actually be proven because during egyptian times the north star was a historical called dubin okay and now tubing is located present time in the middle of our equator and so yeah global warming isn't real and will happen and what's happening now is actually something called pole shift,1_Cópia de andrewnaltimari_1587771672_6819427402590997765,1

468, but now decline is there a policy that is the focus of tonight's angle now it's been twenty months with democrats in charge of congress and the white house so we thought tonight would just ask this question how are things looking well let's do a quick inventory shall we first the economy is collapsing we do begin though with our talk of the favorite is this ugly market down again today sharply after a one day reprieve and now fresh concerns about what lies ahead for your money we appear to be drifting into war with russia russian president vladimir putin told his people that the u s is bent on destroying the russian homeland on wednesday he drafted three hundred thousand reservists and threaten nuclear war this is not a bluff he said and china is threatening the united states laughs obviously that's crime rising across the country our schools are failing our people are being poisoned by fentanyl greatest threat facing our communities our families our children is the cartels the two cartels in mexico that are responsible for the vast the amount of fentanyl that is in the united states today and our borders are undefended this is a plan disaster by the by the administration is hurting the entire country now faced with all these facts the biden regime has decided to focus on three priorities number one find a way to indict donald trump for anything number two find a way to blame ron desantis for the harm resulting from a hurricane and number three try to get you know the midterm voters to choose more abortions over restoring prosperity and safety no wonder populism is booming everywhere no wonder most of the watch races that were closer leaning democrat just a few weeks ago are now either toss ups are leaning republican now i want you to look at wisconsin where incumbent sen ron johnson who was supposedly in a weak position a few weeks back is now up five against mandela barnes or tim mitchell's who's in essentially a dead heat with incumbent liberal tony evers and the governor's race there and then doctor oz while he's closing in on mister hoodie without a clue john fetterman he's only down by four so people are waking up not just to the wreckage that the democrats and their policies have left behind but i think now more of you are starting to ask is all this intentional or as texas state aj you just heard him say ken paxton he called the border nightmare a planned disaster now remember even before biden's inauguration they began to flash the green light to central americans essentially it was beyond any of those i mean we knew right how to restore the border restore order they're close it down because trump did it but biden did the opposite he ditched the remain in mexico pa policy and put carla in charge if there was ever a sign that the white house never intended to enforce our border that was it another clue that this was intentional biden and his crew have made it abundantly clear that they think america has a terrible past that informs our present racism is an american problem gets reflected in discrimination in housing and employment in the justice system racism is real in america and it has always been xenophobia is real in america and always has been sexism to original sin of slavery weaved white supremacy into our founding documents and principles now if america is truly systemic cli racist you know after brown vs board of education after the civil rights movement after the election of the first black president two times how can the system that is that corrupt after all of that be saved at all well the answer from the left is it can't be saved they hate our constitution they hate our judeo-christian tradition they hate capitalism and they now believe it needs to be reset courtesy of george soros now the reset which they've discussed ad nauseum on college campuses and at davos requires a complete reordering of all of society but especially american society that means things like no more employment no more jobs based on objective criteria or merit in the two hundred and thirty two year history of the u s department of treasury to hold that position she's making history first black woman the first openly gay member of the biden administration the first openly trans assistant secretary for health you get the point the biden cabinet top staff and they're presiding over one nightmare after another they offer no solutions only actions that make matters worse but their firsts so we all should just forget about the failures so an administration that was focused on truly serving the american people truly improving their standard of living and safety they would have canned yelling at treasury may orcas austin at the pentagon granholm and energy buddha judge from transportation they would have been fired months ago so it leads us to the only the sensible conclusion their goal is our decline but today inflation that you know yell and ignored well it has the markets down to it's lowest point since november twenty twenty i believe there is a path through this that can succeed in bringing down inflation while also maintaining what i think all of us would regard as a strong labor market my god how is she even employed the supply chain that mayor pete has was supposed to address it still messed up over one point five billion dollars are going into grant awards across the country announced today to build that world leading transportation system strengthen supply chains create jobs advance equity and improve economic opportunity and china's on the move in south and central america and even funding russia's war in ukraine meanwhile john kerry the climate czar is left begging china to keep focusing on climate change what can be done about china's seeming reluctance to participate in the affairs of climate controls that other nations will try to make the china interestingly enough the china has a plan more electric vehicles will be put on the road over the next year or so in china than in all the rest of the world put together okay you get the drift here america is humiliated that clip from john kerry is an example of our humiliation or poorer and we're weaker and it's just the way the left loves it because they want to create as many wards of the state as they can as many people dependent on the government as they can why do you think the left wing governors refused to open during covert when it was obvious they could because what they care more about families and young people police they didn't care about the families of the young people this was all about setting the stage for the new normal a new normal when you would have less freedom less travel a lower standard of living lowered expectations i remember when global elites are in power they'll always always find an excuse to take away your freedom under bush it was nine eleven and the patriot act of course the pandemic the lockdowns and big tech censorship then it was january six and the deo js domestic terror focus and now of course they cite climate change they'll ban gas-powered cars gas appliances and cause energy prices to skyrocket remember through all of this to them we are the real threat and they feel that they need to restrain us this is why they are so threatened by people like georgia maloney the new italian prime minister she's warning our citizens not to fall for this domination play of the left she wants italian schools to teach not to turn students against their parents or their culture in what really unnerved them m is that she

471, in seven seventy one percent of americans recognize climate change is real this number drops to fifty one percent of americans in two thousand and nine and reached its lowest with only forty four percent of americans believe in climate change two thousand and eleven so while this number has rebounded since then and now a lot of people are more aware that climate change is real at this climate denialist movement kind of cemented itself as a fundamental aspect of the conservative beliefs additionally this climate denialism was not born out of these panelists questioning or doubting the data of the near unanimous ninety seven percent of climate scientists but it was because new la from capitalist to realise that if climate change were real it would require huge government effort and intervention and restrictions on global free trade which is largely through the burning of fossil fuels and this fundamentally threatened the neo liberal ideology that free trade and market fundamentalism is the best economic system said that they had been pushing for through the eighties and nineties and that they thought to have been secured by the collapse of the u s s r in the fall of communism so now faced with climate change a lot of these neo liberal capitalists find it much easier to deny reality rather than allow their worldview to be shattered and this is march easily the reason for the rise in this climate denialism and a lot of these conservative think tanks like the heartland institute are empowered and funded by billionaires and fossil fuel executives and fossil fuel corporations that obviously have incentive to spread this misinformation and this explains why today people see climate action or these people see climate action as a kind of trojan horse for establishing socialism and big government funnily enough they're not too wrong you know if they had started acting on climate change back in the eighties and gradually reducing them missions until we could evolve to be more sustainable they could have retained their economic and political hegemony but now in the year two thousand and twenty one we're faced with the reality that,1_Cópia de entomopolotics_1627073360_6988226856285637894,1

646, the hi i'm michelle sterling for friends of science society on the same day that sixteen year old greta thunberg delivered her impassioned speech to the un on her claim that there's a climate emergency a group of five hundred qualified scientists and commentators sent the un secretary general this registered letter making it clear that there is no climate emergency for some reason despite most major news outlets claiming that they are covering climate now this has not surfaced as news that's curious this isn't it i know that our organization sent the press release to at least five hundred media contacts so maybe it will just reach more people if i just read the message to you your excellencies there is no climate emergency a global network of more than five hundred knowledgeable and experience scientists and professionals in climate and related fields have the honor to address your excellencies in the attached european climate declaration for which the signatories to this letter are the national ambassadors the general circulation models of climate on which international policy is at play present founded are unfit for their purpose therefore it is cruel as well as imprudent to advocate the squandering of trillions on the basis of results from such immature models current climate policies pointlessly grievously undermine find the economic system putting the lives at risk in countries denied access to affordable continuous electrical power we urge you to follow a climate policy based on sound science realistic economics and genuine concern for those harmed by costly but unnecessary attempts at mitigation we ask you to place the declaration on the agenda of your imminent new york session we also invite you you to organize with us a constructive high level meeting between world class scientists on both sides of the climate debate early in twenty twenty the meeting will give effect to the sound and ancient principle no less of sound science than of natural justice that both sides should be fully in fairly heard audio tour at altera pars please let us know your thoughts about such a joint meeting yours sincerely ambassadors of the european climate declaration so here are the main points that they made there's no climate emergency climate science should be less political natural as well as anthropogenic factors cause warming warming is far slower than predicted climate policy relies on inadequate c o two carbon dioxide is plant food the basis of all life on earth global warming has not increased natural disasters climate policy must respect sir scientific and economic realities there is no climate emergency there's no cause for panic and alarm we strongly oppose the harmful and unrealistic net zero c o two policy proposed for twenty fifty if better approaches emerge we will have ample time to reflect and adapt the aim of international policy should be to provide reliable and affordable energy at all times and throughout the world so that is the end of the message sent to the un by five hundred experts scientists and qualified commentators i sincerely hope this statement will offer young people some peace and comfort while i respect the desire of so many young people and children to stand up for something i see that some people are are literally frightened into paralyzing anxiety that's not how children should live their lives and as you just saw it doesn't reflect the scientific facts i hope all of you will research the topic of climate change and and see how vast and interesting it is and and not just listen to activists like greta i respect gratitude she's clearly acting out of deep passion and fear but as these five hundred scientists point out there's nothing to fear there's no climate emergency everyone can go back to school and study science math and the stars we live in a world of wonder let's be great grateful for our many blessings and all the good we've inherited from generations past we stand on the shoulders of giants let us respect our elders and honor all they have provided us with for friends of science society i'm michelle sterling the,1_irish1916irish_1674485248_7191859359981374725,1

759, patrol was what we thought it was that it wasn't fossil fuel it didn't come from animals yeah it's rural rural like any other mineral is that is that how it is and how it to what would you say what's the origin of your scene when they first found petroleum because they were beginning to make motors and needed an axles or wheels on railroad trains and all that sort of thing and remember train started in the beginning of the nineteenth century then oil went from a just a lubricant to a fuel and it made it valuable and rockefeller happened to be the smartest man in the business at the time but he made a lot of most of his money of much of it off the transport of the petroleum as well as selling him but one thing they realised was if you cause oil the oil is putting a price on oil is like putting a price on a pale of water in all of it no no initial cost is in the ground and in those days they were some of it almost what you'd call surface mining the oil it didn't go down deep so in order to get the price nice up they hit on the idea that they would have to make it appear to be scarce that they're that boy after we take the next few barrels out we're probably going to have to close as well you know that kind of thing but very fortuitous event in eighteen ninety two there was a convention in geneva of scientists to determine what organic substances arm while the definition of organic is a substance with hydrogen oxygen and carbon and so it's usually a living substance a tree you analyze a dead tree hydrogen carbon and oxygen and grass and so on living things animals we are hydrogen oxygen and carbon so at this geneva convention rockefeller took advantage of sending some science this over who said oil petroleum is hydrogen oxygen and carbon therefore it must be derived from the the spoiling the rotting of formerly living matter and playing the game properly when the this scientific convention was over they defined oil as a the residue from formerly living matter well that makes it a fossil fuel i dunno why they decided to use the word face title but it says formerly living matter is fossil will of course today and and another thing we should know is that there has never been a fossil of a a real fossil found below sixteen thousand feet and you can't argue at sixteen thousand there's a level line because some place that goes round sinks and so on but sixteen is what the scientists say sixteen thousand we mine oil or we we drill for oil at thirty thousand thirty three thousand twenty eight thousand every day of the week so right there we rule that out that it isn't fossil fuel it's called fossil fuel for the minds of the public to feel that it is an asset that is running are being depleted we talk about depletion allowance which is a lot of you know and actually if you know the world's oil supply you know that it is not going to run out for an awfully long time it is the second most prevalent liquid on earth and we haven't begun to the well with all that background you see the people in charge of the petroleum business for perfectly reasonable business things are like any other man in the business wants to keep his price as high as he can get away with and a way to do is just say well as no more we we were the last barrel is going to cost one thousand dollars and that is all done and and they preach that stuff what bothers me is that that in geology books it's in there the geologists say it's a fossil fuel that they've somehow they've been bought i went to a four year federal staff energy seminar run by the government of the united states during the so called energy crisis i was the participant that represented the railroad industry the airline industry was there every a administrative assistant of senators and congressmen was there where the cia was there the defense department was there the state department was there some time sitting right in front of me in the role would be henry kissinger with his friend the the head of the department of defense sir that's too bad i can't put the names for them but anyway people like that top men in the government sitting here listening to the federal staff energy seminar well what this was doing is for four years they were teaching a propaganda line to the leading people in this country and therefore to the leading people in the world when you include the history a slash injuries hit kissinger and slasher among others and the object of it was as kissinger using his own terms when it was time for him to speak to create a world price for oil in other words not thirty cents a gallon here and ninety cents a gallon there but let's get away world price as they're gone and they're trying to do that for wheat and everything else we don't realize what what the controls are whether as oil or some of these other things almost everything today is being categorized at the highest price they can possibly make it go and so calling petroleum or fossil fuel or is the basis for this system with respect to petroleum bid from that strange meeting at eighteen ninety two a scientific convention mg i have a big thick scientific encyclopedia put

841, this is an incredibly common comment every single time that i talk about climate change somebody says this climate change is inevitable the climate has changed for billions of years it will change for billions of years after we're gone the climate has always changed it is always changing it will always change and there's nothing you can do about it and the hang up here is that this person is correct there is absolutely natural climate change i'm not even talking about the hind that is caused by living organisms changing the atmosphere like we've talked about before just totally natural lifeless ways in which climate change occurs on this and pretty much every the other planet all the time forever this person is correct but the issue is that that's not the kind of climate change we are talking about we are talking about anthropogenic climate change anthro meaning human genet meaning creating human caused climate change that's what we're talking about and there is a big difference see the type of climate change that this commenter's talking about is caused by milan kiewit cycles and those have three major components and those are eccentricity obliquity and procession here's what those mean eccentricity has to deal with the shape of our orbit the more eccentric it is the more oval shape that it is the less eccentric the more circular that it is and this fluctuates a little bit because the earth is kind of caught in between these tidal forces from the sun and the jovian planets namely jupiter and saturn pulling in different directions that stretches out or compresses our orbit a little bit over time obliquity refers to the amount that the earth is tilted on it's axis right now we're tilted about twenty three and a half degrees but that's only about halfway between the extremes that it could possibly and has in the past reach so this little wobble here also makes a big difference especially in the way that the seasons work and then procession refers to the fact that that axial tilt the angle between the north and the south poles there that is also slowly rotating so not only responding in this way but we're also slowly slowly rotating that way so what's really important to remember with these no longer cycles is that each of those three components take between tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of years to occur so the full cycle here takes millions and millions of years and that is not what we are seeing to today we are seeing dramatic temperature shifts caused by changes in atmospheric chemistry occurring over the course of a few decades that scary but the good news is that even though anthropogenic climate change is the single greatest existential threat facing humanity at this moment climate scientists and environmental scientists and sustain,1_ssstik.io_1673708749795,1

884, last week i was standing right there it is underwater imagined so much rain at the san francisco bay is freshwater that sounds extreme but it is what could be happening right now there was an article in scientific american magazine which i was obsessed with in college and i was obsessed with this particular article that talked about atmospheric rivers specifically the atmospheric river like west of the north american continent over the pacific ocean that could hold ten to fifteen mississippi rivers worth of water and about every two hundred or so years it would dump on california and cause a mega flood the article explained that because of climate change this could could begin to happen once a century and it's been about one hundred and sixty years since the last one so it could very we're very much in the timeframe where it is time for the atmospheric river to empty it's contents onto the state of california and while we need the rain this state does not have the infrastructure to support this in the southern part of the state we're going to end up with hella landslides because of this and the central part of the state which is really where it's problematic specifically sacramento and the river is flooding you see it in this woman's video and the dams are full the levees are supposedly breaking there is flooding it is bad the last time this happened in the mid eighteen hundreds it killed supposedly a quarter of the cattle in the state tons of people cause so much money's worth of damage because again even then we didn't have the infrastructure to deal with this because we don't have to deal with it except for once every one or two hundred years but we haven't had to deal with it in the modern world and now it could be really bad so i just wanted to share this because i think it's fascinating if you google scientific american magazine atmospheric rivers find an article from the mid twenty tens and that's the one i'm talking about it was so interesting when they discovered the atmospheric river above the pacific ocean and supposedly there's one to the west of most continents that can just like empty itself onto the continent every so often and they then examined the sediment records around the san francisco bay and that's how they found that the bay was freshwater like that is insane i'm sure it was probably brackish but like regardless that is unbelievable amounts of water and anyway i just wanted to share because i have been obsessed with this article since i read it i don't know why but like i thought it was just fascinating that there's ten to fifteen mississippi rivers worth of water just above the ocean a mile up like what or the fact that the bay was freshwater it's all insane,1_ssstik.io_1673709900839,1
885, it's an assault on human liberty climates lockdowns climate locked up and we are just numbers to be moved on a on a graph really nuts really really frightening how people really going to comply with this i this is called smiles rebel news and i'll have come here to oxford where the county council have a great trial climate lockdowns in twenty twenty four half hour lockdown loving politicians go mad with the idea of indefinite power while i've come here to see what climate lockdown would look like and how it would affect people's everyday lives so what does a climate lockdown look like well under oxfordshire county council's proposals residents of oxford will be split up into six zones or districts so if you have a car and you want to drive between zones you can only do that up to one hundred times per year your car will have to be registered with the council and if you wish to drive between zones more than one hundred times you'd have to apply for special permission as if you live in a house where there's more than one car there's no way to cheat the system each house is limited to one hundred trips between them to take a married couple for example if they work two separate jobs that's fifty trips each between the newly proposed districts i know exactly why what you're thinking why on earth would anyone want to bring this in they say it's to ease congestion lower harmful emissions and to make oxford a more sustainable city on the other hand is it more overreaching government powers being snuck in under the guise of saving the planet you must be wondering how on earth could something like this be enforced well duncan enright oxfordshire county council's cabinet member for travel and development strategy said in october that roadblocks will divide the city into six fifteen minute neighborhoods this cute new phrase fifty minute neighborhoods sounds very catchy and innocent and is essentially the idea that you'll have everything within fifty minutes of your home as you can imagine the outrage in the city and around the entire ca entry has been immense with both oxford city and county council receiving a barrage of abuse online meaning they've taken to social media to try and firefight the uproar only oxford city council's twitter page they came out with a series of tweets to clear up some of the supposed confusion or misinformation around the climate lockdowns firstly they don't like the term climate lockdown and preferring to use traffic filtering system much more palatable and easy easier to slip by in a series of tweets they claimed the staff had received extreme abuse but also that misinformation has also resulted in both councils receiving numerous calls and social media messages from worried residents addressing the concerns over physical barriers they wrote the traffic filters and not a physical barrier of any kind and will not be physical road closures they are simply traffic cameras that read number plates if a vehicle passes through the filter certain times of the day the camera will read the number plate and if you don't have an exemption or residence permit you will receive a fine the post thank goodness for that i bet the people of oxford are relieved to hear that there won't be any physical barriers however the council will find you into poverty if you try to enjoy freedom of movement thankfully they also neatly wrap up this dystopia with some lovely sustainable key words our aim is to reduce traffic levels and congestion make the buses faster and more reliable and make cycling and walking safer and more pleasant definitely nothing to do with the world economic forum's agenda twenty thirty and severely restricting your freedoms so will oxford residents be confined their local area according to oxford council know the fifty minute neighborhoods proposal aims to ensure that every resident has all the essentials shops healthcare parks within a fifteen minute walk from the home they aim to support and add services not restrict them thankfully they're clearing that up up for a second there people must have thought they are being forced into an intrusive system that they didn't want where they'd restrict your freedoms track your movements and ultimately find you into poverty no you silly goose is definitely isn't part of digital slavery reassuringly they tell us under traffic filters residents will still be able to drive to every part of the city at any time but in the future at times when filters are operating you may need to take a different route if you want to travel by car so subtly worded it almost sounds reasonable yes of course you can travel freely but only when we say absolutely you can travel wherever you want only if you take the designated route we allow will oxfordshire residents need permission from the council to travel across the city no says oxford council boats in the future oxford residents will be able to apply for permit to drive through the filters on up to one hundred days per year so yeah you'll have to apply to the council for freedom of movement this next tweet i thought was extremely telling have oxford councils secretly tried to introduce traffic filters the proposal for traffic filters was first consulted on in twenty nineteen and then updated in february twenty twenty two following this update several months of engagement work was carried out with the stakeholders across the city to form further updated proposals which were announced in august twenty twenty two allow large number of changes were made to the skiing as a result of the consultation including the introduction of one hundred day passes for each resident and reductions in the hours of operation of some filters i bet the people of oxford feel at ease knowing that council is kindly allowing them a hundred trips between districts in instead of gnome they continue explaining how they did some minimal outreach which was analyzed by an independent research company and this helped the oxfordshire county council's cabinet meeting on the twenty ninth of november twenty twenty two essentially they did some cursory outreach and then quietly voted to bring in climate lockdowns under the guise of another name traffic filtering they concluded their tweets by saying the scheme will be introduced as a trial during which an additional consultation will be carried out to further refine the scheme a final decision will then be made on whether or not the filter should be made permanent a decision will be made a decision not by the people of oxford but by the select few lockdown loving politicians so why oxford what has to be trolled somewhere and perhaps oxford was the best candidate city it has a ring road that they want to encourage people to use and that's a perfect excuse oxford's councils are all being run by global warming fanatics from the labour party the liberal democrats and the green party these politicians loved the lockdown so having them indefinitely must sound like a pretty good idea to these lockdown lovers and what a more noble cause than saving the planet from global warming there is of course no denying that what we are seeing now is scarily similar to the agenda twenty thirty goals as les laid out by the world economic forum the tentacles of the world economic forum have reached far and wide in parliaments around the world but are they now reaching as far as oxford county council even on the world economic forum's website there is a mention of the fifteen minute city and they conveniently have a map making a restricted existence look appealing digitally tracked and surveyed with your freedoms taken away on the whims of a politician doesn't appeal to most but the question is is this the framework for the dystopian world the world economic former striving for but an even bigger question is will you comply this has been called smiles rebel news here in oxford,1_ssstik.io_1673709949110,1

917, hillary beautiful people i wanted to discuss something with you here in california when i ask people how do you implement sustainability in your daily life people usually give me the look of a deer in the headlights and then they blurt out i recycle and i go do anything else ninety five percent of the people really don't have a follow up to that which is shocking this is the most progressive state one of the most progressive states and people just don't have any clue so i realize that sustainability is a learned experience and then i looked into what is real learning well real learning this behavior brought about by sustained practice of the knowledge we gain that being said people just don't have the knowledge hence they cannot change your behavior and when you do the california driving tests you just gotta read a pamphlet that gives you the basics you know where the brake pedal drive and you know that stop what a slop sign looks like and then you got into traffic and you hone your skills by trial and error and that's what we need we need to have a basic understanding and then we can re really move forward right now people have the consensus well it's just me what am i going to do about it well if you're a little red blood cell one of you is not gonna do much but if there's a billion red blood cells you're going to coagulate and stop the bleeding that's how that works we've changed the culture before civil rights gender equality and now when you look at it in terms of even plant-based it's it's a done deal people understand it and so that's what we need to do with sustainability and with our the way we operate on this planet regarding climate change once we've changed the culture that people understand and think about it in terms of what they will gain rather than what they will lose and there's tremendous opportunity this is the new eldorado this is the biggest business opportunity for mankind like ever so this is like the gold rush this is like dotcom tech bitcoin and everything else we can think of put together so again there's tremendous opportunity we just need to get a baseline so we all have at least a basic understanding and the knowledge once we have that we can apply the knowledge and change our behavior and will take care of it it's really not that complicated you know we have scientists they can't sell lemonade on a hot day but right now it's really in the public's mind people have a much higher awareness about what's going on there's tremendous opportunity and so that's a very workable situation so i encourage you to expand your horizons not be afraid of it look into it worried about it learn about it and also ask questions just be interested just be interested is all we need to have and as a bonus we get to save our own asses and make some money so i said it was a pretty good deal thank you,1_talentnetwork_1654636971_7106611672177069354,1

924, there is a lot a lot been going on since since isaac newton and and and all that stuff happened one of the things happened right around the world war two in that same time period before and surely felt afterwards government got realised that scientists aren't look strange dudes that you know hide in in ivory towers and do ridiculous things with with tess two scientists you know made world war two as we know it quite possible i mean they made faster things they made bigger guns to shoot them down with you know they made drugs to give the pilots if they were broken up in the process they made all kinds of and then finally one giant bomb to end the whole thing right everybody step back a little i said you know we gotta to invest in this shit because whoever has got the most of these people working the best pleasure is going to have a dominant position at least in the military and probably in all kinds of economic ways and they got involved in it in the scientific industrial establishment was born and out of that came a lot of scientists who were in there for the money you know because it was suddenly available and they weren't that curious little boys that like to put frogs up in the air they were the same people that later went into medical school you know because there was money in it and then they all got into business i mean there's waves of going into your high school persons that you want to be rich and it'll be a scientist not anymore want to be rich he'd be a businessman but a lot of people got in it for the money and the power and the travel back when travel was easy and low like those people don't think they don't they they they don't always tell you the truth you know there is nothing in their contract in fact that makes it to their advantage always to tell you the truth so and these are the people i'm talking about are people that like they say they they they're a member of the committee can say that enter governmental panel on climate change and they then they have these big meetings where they try to figure out where how are we going to how are we going to continually prove that the planet is getting warmer when that's actually contrary to most people's sensations i mean if you actually measure the temperature over a period i mean the temperature has been measured now pretty carefully for about fifty sixty years longer than that has been measured but in really nice precise ways and records have been kept for fifty or sixty years and in fact the temperature hadn't really gone up it's like the average temperature has gone up a tiny little bit because the nighttime temperatures at weather stations have come up just a little bit but there's good explanation for that and that's what the weather stations are all built outside of town where the airport was and now the towns moved out there this concrete all around and they call it the skyline effect and and most responsible people that measure temperatures realize you have to shield your measuring device from that and even then in the buildings get warm in the daytime and they keep it a little warmer at night so that the temperature has been sort of inching up it should have been but not a lot not like you know what the first the first guy that got the idea that we were going to fry ourselves here actually he didn't think of it that way his name was spot or a heinous he was he was swedish and he said if you double the c o two level in the atmosphere she thought what might this is nineteen hundred the temperature ought to go up about five point five degrees he calculated he was thinking the earth is kind of like you know like a completely ice insulated thing with no stuff in it really just energy coming down energy leaving and so he came up with this theory and he said this'll be cool because it'll be a longer growing season in sweden and the surfers the surface thought that's a cool idea because it's pretty cold in the ocean sometimes but a lot of other people later on started thinking it would be bad but nobody actually demonstrated it i mean the temperature as measured you can find this on our wonderful internet you just go look for all the nasa's records and all the weather bureau's records and look at it yourself and you'll see the temperature has just the nighttime temperature you're measured on the surface of the planet has gone up a tiny little bit so if you just average that the daytime temperature it looks like it went up about point seven degrees in the century but in fact it was just coming up it was the nighttime the daytime temperatures didn't go up so and our heinous theory and all of the global warmers that they would say yeah it should go up in the daytime too if it's the greenhouse effect now people will like things that have like names like that they can envision it right i mean but people don't like things like this most i mean you don't get all excited about things like the actual evidence which would be evidence for strengthening of the tropical circulation in the nineteen nineties the paper that came out february most of you probably hadn't heard about it evidence for large decadal variability in the tropical mean radiative energy budget excuse me those papers were published by nasa and some scientists at columbia and the leakey and a whole bunch of people princeton and those two papers came out in science magazine february the first and the the the conclusion in both of these papers and also the science of editors like description of these papers for the the quickie is that our theories about global warming are completely wrong i mean what what these guys were doing as what the nasa people have been saying this for a long time they said if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere it isn't showing up is not going up at all we've been doing it very carefully now for twenty years from satellites and it isn't going up and in this paper they show something much more striking and that was that they did what they call radiation you'd go into details edit actually it's quite complicated but it isn't as complicated as they might make you think it is by the words they use those papers if you really get down to the the sun puts out a certain amount of energy we know how much that is it falls on the earth the earth gives back a certain amount when it gets warm it it generates it makes redder energy like that i mean like infrared like something that's warm gives off infrared the whole business of the of the globe the the global warming trash really is that that if the if there's too much c o two in the atmosphere the the heat that trying to escape won't be able to get out but the heat coming from the sun which is mostly down and in the like three fifty nanometers where it's centered that goes right through c o two so you still get heated but you don't dissipate any one of these guys measured all those things i mean you could talk about that stuff and you can write these large reports and you can get government money to do it but these are actually measured it and it turns out that in the last ten years that's why there's a decade that the the energy the level of what they call imbalance has been way the hell over what was expect like the amount of imbalance meaning pizza coming in and does not going out that you would get from having double the ceo to which we're not anywhere near that by the way but if we did in two thousand twenty five or something have double the c o two we hadn't nineteen one hundred they say it would increase the the energy budget by about another one what per square centimeter more would be coming in than going out so the planet should get warmer well they found out in this study these two studies but two different teams that the five and a half watts per square meter have been coming in nineteen ninety eight ninety ninety nine and the place didn't get warmer theories could pollute these papers should have been called the end to the global the global warming fiasco but they they are they're concerned and you can tell they have very guarded conclusions in these papers because they're talking about big laboratories that are funded by lots of money and bus scared people if they said you know what there isn't a problem with gold global warming any longer so we can that their funding if you start grant request with something like that say global warming obviously hadn't happened if they if they if they had if i actually said that afghan up to and that had to be very cautious but what i'm saying is you can be delighted because the editor of science who is no dummy and both of the these fairly professional really professional teams have come to the same conclusion and the bottom lines in their papers they have to say what this means is that what we've been thinking was the global circulation model that will predict that the earth is going to get overheated that that is all wrong it's wrong by a large factor does not by a small one they just misunderstood misinterpreted the fact that the earth does the same obviously some mechanisms going on that no i knew about because the heat coming in and it didn't getting warmer so the planet has a pretty amazing thing with big horrible and big and wonderful and it does all kinds of things we don't know anything about so i mean the reason i put those things all together here's a way supposed to do science some science has done for other reasons and just curiosity and there's a lotta things like globe warming and ozone hole and you know a whole bunch of scientific public issues that if you're interested in them you have to get down to the details and read the papers called large deck haidl variability in the trop you have to figure out what i was words me and if you'd just listened to the to the to the guys who were hyping those issues and making a lot of money out of you you'll be misinformed and you'll be worse worrying about the wrong things remember the ten things that are going to get you the one of them and the asteroids is the one i really agree with

from climate change green energy is being floated as one of the top solutions we are replacing coal with hydrocarbon fossil fuels with solar energy petrol and diesel cars with electric vehicles even being pitched as cleaner greener and sustainable but are they what's clean for the environment may not really be clean hidden beneath the shiny exteriors of an eevee is a story of blood batteries these cars drive human rights violate nation's extreme poverty and child labor hello and welcome to gravitas plus amplification my father an electric car runs on battery you know that but you know what these batteries are made of rare metals like lithium and cobalt kobe gives the batteries stability and allows it to operate safely it's a bluish grey colored metal it is found in the earth's crust or what we call crustal rocks kobold has several uses like in jet turbine generator stall materials pigments and smartphone batteries but it's major use is in lithium ion batteries half of the coble produced goes into electric co cars were talking about four to thirty kilos of cobalt per battery this metal is found all over the world like in australia canada china cuba south africa the united states the philippines but seventy percent of the total supply comes from one country congo the democratic republic of congo let's zoom into this the country d r congo is the second largest country in africa it's gdp is around forty nine billion dollars congo is synonymous with conflict poverty and corruption beneath the country's red earth is the world's largest deposits of cobalt ninety two million people live here some two million depend on global production there are called negotiations cobalt mining in congo is divided into two categories industrial or large scale mining and artisinal or small scale mining what's the difference between the two artisanal mines are unregulated labor laws do not apply here neither do safety protocols these minds produce twenty to thirty percent of congo's cobalt some two hundred thousand miners work in these mines at least forty thousand of them are children some as young as six these children flirt with death daily they enter vertical tunnels most of them are too narrow for adults to enter inside it's like a furnace the children dig for cobalt under inhuman conditions sometimes they have shovels but mostly they dig with their bare hands they have no masks no gloves no work clothes and sometimes just twenty minutes worth of oxygen but these young children go on for hours after digging they crush the rocks they wash them and carry their finds to the market to find a buyer how much do these children make sometimes as little as a dollar go build is a multi billion dollar industry it is estimated to be worth thirteen point six three billion dollars by twenty twenty seven but this money never reaches a child who is spotting and extracting the metal in poverty stricken congo even a dollar is worth risking one's life many die trying to make this money a b c recently profiled a woman who lost her son to a mind related accident the boy was thirteen years old he told his mother he was going to the market to buy gold for her so that she could cook instead the boy went to a cobalt mine to try and er an extra buck for the house the mine embankment collapsed the thirteen year old never returned home between twenty fourteen and twenty fifteen at least eighty artisanal miners died in congo in twenty nineteen an accident killed forty three minors according to one estimate two thousand illegal miners die in congo every year many suffer poor permanent lung damage skin infection and life-changing injuries in twenty nineteen some families from congo filed a lawsuit they named companies like tesla accused them of aiding and abetting in the death and injury of children the lawsuit spoke about a child he was referred to as john doe one john was working as a human mules since the age of nine he would carry bags after bags of kabul just for zero point seven five dollars a day one day john fell into a tunnel fellow workers dragged him out of it but they left john alone on the ground when the child's parents found out about the accident they rushed to the mining site it was too late john was paralyzed doctors say he will never be able to walk again why do children work in these high risk minds because of poverty and the hope to get out of it families in congo are betting big on cobalt it's like their crypto their chance to make it big the metals demand has tripled in the last decade it is expected to double again by twenty thirty five the demand is being driven by electric vehicles today there are more than six point five million ie vs on the road by twenty forty that number will touch sixty six million so that sixty six million multiplied by thirty kilos of global do the math by twenty fifty the demand for coal gold production is expected to increase five hundred and eighty five percent congo's families want to ride this wave and tidal poverty sending their children to the mines is not a choice for them but necessity these children end up working as artisanal miners or informal workers they're not employed by any company any but several companies line up to buy their fines you see it is cheaper to buy coble from a child than a regulated mine and who understands business better than china most of these companies dealing in blood batteries are from china it dominates the global supply chain of global china owns up to fifty percent of the metals production it controls around eighty percent of goebbels refining in the last fifteen years chinese companies have bought out north american and european companies mining in congo today chinese firms on fifteen out of the nineteen industrial minds in this country in exchange for congo scoble china has promised the country billions in investment in the form of infrastructure schools and roads now congo is another example of how stories featuring china never end well today china is leaking blood cobalt into the supply chain of electric vehicles chinese companies are buying cobalt from children encouraging them to participate in the trade of blood batteries one of the largest global processes as in congo is a company called c d m r congo dongfang mining it is a subsidiary of their jiang y u cobot a chinese company of course y u supply scoble to electric carmakers like volkswagen forty percent of lawyers cobalt comes from congo in twenty sixth eighteen the chinese company was called out by an ngo which was branded a benefactor of child labor while pledged to clean up it's act but did anything change on the ground reports raise serious doubts this is one part of the story there is blood in china's large-scale minds to their work workers are abused discriminated beaten and made to work without contract and sufficient ration one worker told the media and i'm quoting if a worker dies the chinese don't report to the government they bury the person hiding the corpse and bribe the family to keep quiet that's your electric car killing people even before it hits the road did you sign up for this that was the biggest carmakers are complicit in these crimes i'm talking about the likes of tesla volvo renault mercedes-benz folks vog and they all source global from chinese mines in congo sure they claim to have a zero tolerance policy when it comes to child labor but they do know that there is no way to fully map their supply chains back in congo president felix tshisekedi has pledged to act in twenty nineteen he established a state run company to focus on health and human rights but that hardly helps when congolese officials are accused of overseeing child labor in twenty twenty tesla announced it would start using cobalt free lithium iron bat batteries in electric vehicles but the company followed up the announcement with a deal with glencore it's a kobold mining company and this deal was for six thousand tonnes of cobalt a year six thousand tons a year doesn't add up does it much like the claim of electric cars being clean these cars run on dirty energy on

958, hey guys start to observe the weather patterns and see what you notice today in los angeles so far this morning we have what appears to be a more natural cloud cover and coincidentally cooler times and you'll notice when there's geoengineering that's when it's hot so just observe and see if you think that bill gates and his little friends want to do is a good idea the guy today let's enjoy it,1_wuwuwomanenergy777_1650148330_7087333106826480939,1

961, good morning guys so this is the sky over los angeles california right now and obviously we're having some geo engineering where they're spraying metals chemicals who knows what into this guy now let me remind you that california has given a drought warning and have told us we can't water our grass and conserve water they're ours signs off the side of the freeway in los angeles spreading fear saying limit watering drought and liquid they're doing this they use this mainly for whether they say they're blocking the sun to cool the earth but it's always hotter when they spray and this is used for weather model vacation and they definitely have the technology to make it rain if they wanted to so why are they doing this and then claiming there's a drought so i make orgone energy generators they can help repel this pollution and this is insane guys like think about what's going on think about what they're telling you versus the reality does it make sense okay have a good day,1_wuwuwomanenergy777_1659545472_7127693512665189678,1
963, hey guys so i just want to show you all at least the geo engineering i'm here in los angeles california and we've had several days of a heat wave going on here with temperate temps in the hundreds nineties and they've been spraying the sky so i dunno why people learn talking about that in regards to quote unquote global warming or climate change cause it in my observations it's always a lot hotter when they spray we had a period of about three weeks earlier in the summer in like june where they did not spray and the temps were like eighty degrees every day it was beautiful and this march meaning here in california where mind you are crazy governor gavin newsom has said we're going to go to all electric cars there's going to be no more gas cars and then he tells you we don't have the electric grid for your electric cars don't charge them do you guys think is going on here you know what i mean obviously we need to stop pollution but this is the pollution we need to stop is geo engineering because they're making it hot and then telling us oh my gosh it's too high we need to impose restrictions like don't use your electricity don't use your ac and does that sound familiar what happened the last few years they're creating all these problems and then telling you oh we need to there's all these problems that they created and we need to impose restrictions on you and take your freedom and i'm not saying gas cars are perfect kt but the reason they want you in electric cars is because they don't go as far and they can shut them off whenever they want so this is about freedom and seeing what these people are really up to cause i'm a little skeptical of the narrative and we had rain this morning here in l a it was raining and then they send the planes over and now the rain stopped and it's hot again you know what i mean it's like if you guys can control the weather make it rain here what's going on so just wanted to let you guys know my little take here on what's going on with the,1_wuwuwomanenergy777_1662681675_7141163405783616810,1
964, hey guys i took a video three days ago at the beach where i wanted to show how there had been geo engineering and it seemed likely that that was the cause of the hot weather that was happening three days ago and i wanted to show you the contrast today today we have a lot of fluffy natural clouds in los angeles and by contrast we have cooler temperatures so it seems as though when they spray the skies view engineering if the weather is hotter and we have what they call global warming and when we have natural clouds the weather is more mild and cool and natural weather should be allowed to occur because it's the planet's way of cleansing themselves like when we sweat we sweat our talk the planet has to cleanse itself in that way choose when they're constantly messing with whether that's not good that's pollution so if you want to help repel the metals from when they spray i have found that oregon energy can really help that i got a combustor over here but before i even had a combustor i had a bunch of tower busters maybe six of them at grid around my house and at that time i did a rainwater her lab tests where i tested my rainwater against a friends who had no organ in his rainwater i'm not kidding you guys had forty two times more aluminum in it that's what they're spraying over us and it's going into our resources and so yeah if you want to be a true environmentalist maybe we should,1_wuwuwomanenergy777_1666484873_7157497987374304558,1
965, in learning guys so i'm out taking a hike in beautiful los angeles and we have what appears to be a gorgeous natural cloud cover today and subsequently cooler temps and i just thought i would make a quick video sharing site some of my observations about weather patterns and geo engineering now i work a lot with energy i make organ energy generators which help to mitigate harmful mf electro smog like five g and they all to repel the pollution the fallen metals from geoengineering rainwater lab tests have shown so what is really going on with the geoengineering programs my observations have shown that on the days that they're spraying the temperatures are an average of about five to ten or even fifteen degrees warmer i've been observing this for years and i would love it if some amateur scientist out there wants to in their area it'd be great if people did this just take a node everyday what is the high temp and are they spraying the sky that day or not because i've noticed for example today it's a lot cooler it's in the sixties earlier this week we had temps in the high seventies and they were spraying so today this is beautiful it gives us a snapshot of what really happens when they are not spring the sky and the air is much fresher sometimes there's a chemical smell when they spray so what is their real agenda i mean i speculate it's to take freedom because look what they're doing they're saying oh my gosh the climate the climate and then it's going to lead to you now you can't go here and you can't do this you know what i mean so keep your eye on the world economic forum they are troublemakers but i'm gonna enjoy this beautiful day look gorgeous,1_wuwuwomanenergy777_1669851804_7171958839422635307,1
966, hey guys it's a beautiful day in los angeles with natural clouds and cooler temperatures so i thought i'd do a little video about climate and the real reason or reasons behind you engineering i did a video a little bit ago about how my observations have shown that when the temperatures are hotter nine times out of ten they're spraying the sky and when temperatures are cooler and more pleasant nine times out of ten they're not we have natural cloud cover and i was talking about how i suspect one of the main reasons behind the geo engineering program is so that they can create the so called climate change which planets fluctuate in temperature naturally anyway but i believe that they're trying to alter it to scare us to say oh my gosh the plan is heating up the climate and the climate and now you can't go here and you can do this like i used especially one reason is to restrict freedom but also we have to take into consideration energy for those who don't know i wrote a book called synergies a modern healers guide to complete bioenergy wellness about healing the energy body and i work a lot with energy oregon energy energy healing and you know we're going through the ascension right now where our planet is moving into an area with much more photonic light we have a lot more high frequency energy coming into the planet you have to question well are they spraying this guy not to block the sun and so called cool the earth which is not doing it's doing the opposite it seems are they trying to block this high frequency energy and also for those who are sensitive gms like myself when you transmit that harmful mf from your wifi using orgone energy you notice a huge difference in your ability to connect to higher frequencies when you eat a cleaner diet you have an easier time connecting to higher frequencies do you see where i'm going with this when you avoid fear news you connect a higher frequency energy so it's not only an agenda to fool us into suppressing our own freedom but it's also to trap us in a lower vibration so if you take care of your health and avoid as much as you can their toxins whether they're spraying them putting them in your food putting them in your body in other ways you know where i'm going with that then you can connect to higher frequencies easier and connects to the real universe not the metaverse which is what i do when i come out here in nature okay have a good day guys and if you want more info go to my website we were women dot com w huge wu women dot com all kinds of info my book my shop,1_wuwuwomanenergy777_1669854861_7171971977580694826,1
967, hey guys i'm at the park in los angeles and i thought i'd do a quick video because this is a perfect example of what we have going on in the sky right now how would you tell the difference between natural clouds and geo engineered clouds so initially when i got here this morning we had thick cloud cover her beautiful fluffy natural clouds and now so you can still see those but as you can see over here they are starting their little trails where they're coming through trying to break it up and when you look up here and you can see kinds of these little lines it gets better over here there's it's hard to pick up in the camera trying to zoom in we got these little lines in the sky if you can see that that is indicative of the harp ionosphere the electrical grid that is going over our skies so when you see the fluffy natural clouds the weather's typically cooler the air fresher and then they come in with their polluting planes and try to control the weather well but anyway we had a beautiful morning here with great clouds so let's focus on that just some quick tips,1_wuwuwomanenergy777_1670374150_7174202293246496046,1
